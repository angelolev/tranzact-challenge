# Tranzact Challenge

## ðŸ“– Stack

As a personal decision to work on this challenge and according to my current experience with different tools I've worked with, I decided to use the following tecnologies:

**React** - Front end library\
**Typescript** - For typing JS files\
**Vite** - Bundler optimizer and compiler\
**Vitest + React testing library** - A Vite-native unit test framework\
**Redux Toolkit** - State management\
**Sass** - CSS preprocessor and styling\
**React Sliding Pane** - Library to help with an accessible and cleaner Portal for Sliding pane\
**Vercel** - Deployment platform

***

## ðŸ’» Live version

I have used Vercel as deployment platform so you should be able to play with the project in the following link:

**NOTE**: It's optimized to get a better look and feel on mobile resolution
